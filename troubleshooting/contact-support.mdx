## Temporary Workarounds

While waiting for support response, try these common workarounds:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WhatsApp not working">
    **Workaround**: Create appointments manually via dashboard.

    Go to **Appointments** → **Create** and book on behalf of patient.

    Notify patient via SMS/call.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No availability showing">
    **Workaround**: Book outside normal hours temporarily.

    1. Add temporary work hours (e.g., extend closing time by 1 hour)
    2. Book appointment
    3. Revert work hours after booking
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subscription limit reached">
    **Workaround**: Enable overage temporarily.

    Go to **Settings** → **Subscription** → **Allow Overage** (toggle ON).

    Note: You'll be charged €0.35 per appointment over limit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance slow">
    **Workaround**: Use filters to reduce data loaded.

    - Dashboard: Select shorter date range (last 7 days instead of 30)

## Feedback and Feature Requests

<Info>
We welcome feedback and feature requests even if not an "issue".
</Info>

**How to submit**:

1. **In-app feedback**: Click **Feedback** button (top right) in dashboard
2. **Email**: feedback@namsec.es
3. **Community forum**: Coming soon

**What to include**:
- Use case: What are you trying to achieve?
- Current limitation: What prevents you from doing it?
- Proposed solution: How would you like it to work?
- Impact: How many users/clinics would benefit?
- Workaround: Are you using a temporary workaround?

**Example**:

```
Feature Request: Bulk appointment creation

USE CASE:
We run group classes (yoga, pilates) with 10-20 people.
Currently, I have to create 20 individual appointments manually.

CURRENT LIMITATION:
No way to create multiple appointments at once.
Takes 5-10 minutes to book a single class.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
- Add "Group Appointment" feature
- Select multiple patients from list
- Create all appointments with one click
- Send bulk WhatsApp notifications

IMPACT:
- Would save 1 hour per day for our clinic
- Fitness centers, language schools would benefit
- Estimated 30% of clinics run group activities

WORKAROUND:
Currently creating appointments one by one.
No good workaround available.
```

<Tip>
Feature requests are prioritized by:
1. Number of clinics requesting it
2. Impact on workflow efficiency
3. Technical feasibility
4. Alignment with product roadmap

Vote on existing requests in the community forum (coming soon).
</Tip>

## Privacy and Data Security

<Warning>
When sharing information with support, ensure compliance with GDPR and data protection laws.
</Warning>

**Best practices**:
- Anonymize patient data: Use "Patient A", "Patient B" instead of real names
- Redact phone numbers: `+34612****` instead of full number
- Blur sensitive info in screenshots (use annotation tool)
- Don't share passwords or API keys (we'll never ask for these)

**What support CAN access**:
- Your clinic configuration (services, work hours, resources)
- System logs (backend errors, API calls)
- Anonymized usage statistics
- Stripe subscription status (with your consent)

**What support CANNOT access**:
- Patient personal data (names, phones, emails) without explicit authorization
- Your password or login credentials
- Payment methods (we only see last 4 digits)
- WhatsApp conversation content (only metadata like timestamps, tool calls)

If support needs to access patient data for debugging, we'll:
1. Ask for explicit written consent
2. Limit access to minimum necessary data
3. Delete/anonymize data after issue resolution
4. Provide audit trail of access
