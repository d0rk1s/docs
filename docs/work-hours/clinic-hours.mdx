## Overview

Clinic hours define when your establishment is **open for business**. These hours serve as the foundation for all appointment scheduling.

<Warning>
If no clinic hours are configured for a specific day, **NO appointments** can be booked that day, regardless of provider availability.
</Warning>

## Step-by-Step Configuration

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/work_hours_create_01_form.png" alt="Formulario de creación de horarios de clínica con selección de día y horas" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Configuración > Horarios de Trabajo** (Settings > Work Hours) in the admin dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Weekday">
    Choose the day of the week you want to configure:

    | Number | Day |
    |--------|-----|
    | 1 | Monday (Lunes) |
    | 2 | Tuesday (Martes) |
    | 3 | Wednesday (Miércoles) |
    | 4 | Thursday (Jueves) |
    | 5 | Friday (Viernes) |
    | 6 | Saturday (Sábado) |
    | 7 | Sunday (Domingo) |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Opening Time">
    Input the clinic opening time in **24-hour format** (HH:MM).

    **Examples**:
    - `09:00` (9:00 AM)
    - `08:30` (8:30 AM)
    - `06:00` (6:00 AM)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Closing Time">
    Input the clinic closing time in **24-hour format** (HH:MM).

    **Examples**:
    - `20:00` (8:00 PM)
    - `22:00` (10:00 PM)
    - `13:00` (1:00 PM)

    <Info>
    Closing time must be **after** opening time. Cross-day periods (e.g., 22:00-02:00) are not supported. Use two separate days if needed.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click **Guardar** (Save) to apply the work hours.

    The system will:
    - Validate no overlaps with existing periods for this day
    - Validate time range (close > open)
    - Invalidate availability cache automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Result: Clinic-Wide Availability

Once configured, the work hours apply to **all providers** in your clinic (unless individual provider hours further restrict availability).

**Example**:

```
Clinic Hours (Monday): 08:00-20:00

Provider A Hours (Monday): 09:00-17:00
  → Available: 09:00-17:00 ✅ (intersection)

Provider B Hours (Monday): Not configured
  → Available: 08:00-20:00 ✅ (uses clinic hours)

Provider C Hours (Monday): 07:00-10:00
  → Available: 08:00-10:00 ✅ (intersection starts at clinic open)
```

## Example Weekly Schedule

Here's a typical clinic schedule configuration:

| Day | Weekday | Clinic Hours | Notes |
|-----|---------|--------------|-------|
| Monday | 1 | 09:00-20:00 | Full day |
| Tuesday | 2 | 09:00-20:00 | Full day |
| Wednesday | 3 | 09:00-13:00 | Half day (morning only) |
| Thursday | 4 | 09:00-20:00 | Full day |
| Friday | 5 | 09:00-20:00 | Full day |
| Saturday | 6 | 10:00-14:00 | Weekend hours |
| Sunday | 7 | *Not configured* | Closed |

<Note>
**Sunday (7)** has no work hours configured, so the clinic is **closed** that day. No appointments can be booked.
</Note>

## Common Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Overlap detected">
    **Problem**: The new work hours overlap with an existing period for the same day.

    **Example**:
    - Existing: 09:00-14:00
    - New: 13:00-17:00
    - Overlap: 13:00-14:00 ❌

    **Solution**: Adjust times to create a gap or make periods contiguous:
    - Option 1: 09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00 (gap)
    - Option 2: 09:00-13:00 + 13:00-17:00 (contiguous)

    See [Multiple Periods Per Day](/work-hours/multiple-periods) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Invalid time range">
    **Problem**: Closing time is before or equal to opening time.

    **Example**:
    - Opening: 09:00
    - Closing: 08:00 ❌

    **Solution**: Ensure closing time > opening time. For overnight periods, split into two days:
    - Day 1: 22:00-23:59
    - Day 2: 00:00-02:00
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Invalid weekday number">
    **Problem**: Weekday must be between 1-7.

    **Solution**: Use the correct weekday number:
    - 1 = Monday
    - 7 = Sunday
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Warning: No appointments can be booked">
    **Problem**: No clinic hours configured for a specific day.

    **Example**:
    - Sunday (7): No work hours → Clinic closed ❌

    **Solution**: Create clinic hours for that day, or use this intentionally for days off.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Configure all active days at once**: Set up your entire weekly schedule in one session to avoid missing days.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use multiple periods for lunch breaks**: Instead of one long period (09:00-20:00) with manual blocking, use split shifts (09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00). See [Multiple Periods](/work-hours/multiple-periods).
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Don't delete work hours for one-time closures**: For holidays or exceptional days, use the **Closures** feature instead. Work hours define your regular weekly schedule.
</Warning>

## What Happens When You Save?

When you create clinic hours, the system:

1. **Validates** no overlaps with existing periods
2. **Validates** time range (close > open)
3. **Saves** to database (`work_hours` table)
4. **Invalidates** availability cache for the clinic
5. **Recalculates** available slots for future dates

<Info>
Cache invalidation is **automatic**. You don't need to manually refresh availability.
</Info>

## Visual Example

**Before Configuration** (Sunday - No Hours):

```
Sunday (7): [CLOSED - No appointments can be booked]
```

**After Configuration** (Sunday 10:00-14:00):

```
Sunday (7): 10:00 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 14:00
            ↓
Available Slots (30-min service):
  10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 12:00, 12:30, 13:00, 13:30
```
