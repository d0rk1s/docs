## What Are Work Hours?

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/work_hours_list_overview.png" alt="Vista general de horarios de trabajo configurados para la clínica y proveedores" />
</Frame>

Work hours define the **availability windows** for your clinic and providers. They control when appointments can be booked in your system.

The work hours system supports two levels:

1. **Clinic Hours**: Define when your clinic is operational
2. **Provider Hours**: Define when individual providers are available (must intersect with clinic hours)

<Note>
**New Feature (2025-11-21)**: Multiple non-contiguous time periods per day are now supported. You can configure split shifts like 09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00 with lunch breaks.
</Note>

## Hierarchy: Clinic Hours → Provider Hours

The system uses an **intersection-based hierarchy**:

```
Clinic Hours:    08:00 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 20:00
Provider A:            09:00 ━━━━━ 13:00
Provider B:                             15:00 ━━━━━ 19:00
Provider C:            09:00 ━━━━━ 13:00 + 15:00 ━━━━━ 19:00

Available Slots:
  - Provider A: 09:00-13:00 ✅
  - Provider B: 15:00-19:00 ✅
  - Provider C: 09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00 ✅
```

<Warning>
If the clinic is **closed** on a day (no clinic-level work hours configured), NO appointments can be booked that day, regardless of provider availability.
</Warning>

## Weekday Numbering

The system uses numeric weekday identifiers:

| Number | Day |
|--------|-----|
| 1 | Monday (Lunes) |
| 2 | Tuesday (Martes) |
| 3 | Wednesday (Miércoles) |
| 4 | Thursday (Jueves) |
| 5 | Friday (Viernes) |
| 6 | Saturday (Sábado) |
| 7 | Sunday (Domingo) |

## Multiple Periods Per Day

You can configure multiple non-contiguous time periods for the same day:

**Example: Split Shift**
```
Monday (1):
  Period 1: 09:00-13:00 (Morning)
  Period 2: 15:00-19:00 (Afternoon)
  Gap: 13:00-15:00 (Lunch break - NO appointments)
```

<Info>
The system generates slots **only within configured periods**, not in gaps. This ensures professional scheduling aligned with your actual availability.
</Info>

## Overlap Validation

The system **prevents overlapping time periods** for the same clinic/provider/weekday:

- **Overlap Formula**: `A_start < B_end AND B_start < A_end`
- **Contiguous Periods**: Allowed when `A_end == B_start` (e.g., 09:00-13:00 and 13:00-17:00)
- **Validation**: Performed at application level before saving

**Examples**:

✅ **Valid**: 09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00 (gap 13:00-15:00)

✅ **Valid**: 09:00-13:00 + 13:00-17:00 (contiguous)

❌ **Invalid**: 09:00-14:00 + 13:00-17:00 (overlap 13:00-14:00)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with clinic hours first">
    Always configure clinic-level hours before setting provider hours. Provider hours are validated against clinic hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use multiple periods for split shifts">
    Instead of one long period with manual blocking, use multiple periods (e.g., 09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00) for automatic gap handling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review overlap validation errors">
    If you get overlap errors, check the formula: `A_start < B_end AND B_start < A_end`. Adjust times to create a gap or make periods contiguous.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use closures for one-time changes">
    For holidays or exceptional days, use the **Closures** feature instead of deleting work hours. Work hours define your regular weekly schedule.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache invalidation is automatic">
    When you create, update, or delete work hours, the system automatically clears availability caches. No manual action needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Work Hours Affect Availability

The availability system follows this logic:

1. **Fetch clinic work hours** for the requested weekday
2. **Fetch provider work hours** for the same weekday
3. **Calculate intersection** of clinic and provider hours
4. **Generate slots** within intersected periods (e.g., every 30 minutes)
5. **Filter conflicts** (existing appointments, closures, external calendars)

**Example**:

```
Request: Availability for Monday (1), 30-minute service

Clinic Hours (Monday): 08:00-20:00
Provider Hours (Monday): 09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00

Intersection: 09:00-13:00 + 15:00-19:00

Generated Slots:
  09:00, 09:30, 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 12:00, 12:30
  15:00, 15:30, 16:00, 16:30, 17:00, 17:30, 18:00, 18:30

NO slots generated: 08:00-09:00, 13:00-15:00, 19:00-20:00
```
