## Overview

The providers list shows all team members who are flagged as providers in your clinic. This view allows you to quickly identify who can deliver services and manage their status.

<Info>
  **Per-Clinic View**: The providers list is filtered by the currently selected clinic. Users who are providers in other clinics but not yours will NOT appear in this list.
</Info>

    From the main menu, click **Providers** or navigate to `/providers`.

  <Step title="Select Clinic Context">
    Ensure the correct clinic is selected in the clinic selector (top-right dropdown). The providers list is filtered by this selection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Provider Cards">
    The system displays all users where `user_clinics.is_provider = true` for the selected clinic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filtering and Searching

### By Status

Filter providers by their current status:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Active Providers" icon="circle-check">
    `status = 'approved'` - Providers currently delivering services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pending Providers" icon="clock">
    `status = 'pending'` - Awaiting approval (new hires, pending verification)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suspended Providers" icon="ban">
    `status = 'suspended'` - Temporarily inactive (leave, suspension)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### By Name or Email

Use the search bar to filter providers by:
- Full name (partial match, case-insensitive)
- Email address

**Example**:
```
Search: "garcía"
Results: Dr. María García, Dr. Ana García López
```

### By Service

Filter providers by the services they deliver:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Service Filter">
    Choose a service from the dropdown (e.g., "Haircut", "Consultation").
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Assigned Providers">
    Only providers assigned to this service are shown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Filter">
    Click "Clear" to show all providers again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Service Assignment**: If a provider doesn't appear when filtering by a specific service, they may not be assigned to that service yet. See [Assign Services](/providers/assign-services) to configure service assignments.
</Tip>

## Understanding Provider Status

### Status Values

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="approved - Active Provider">
    **Meaning**: Provider is active and can deliver services.

    **Availability**: Appears in appointment booking, generates availability slots.

    **Actions**: Can suspend or edit configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="pending - Awaiting Approval">
    **Meaning**: Provider has been added but not yet approved (new hire, onboarding).

    **Availability**: Does NOT appear in appointment booking, no slots generated.

    **Actions**: Approve to activate, or reject to remove.

    **Use Case**: Onboarding new team members before their start date.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="suspended - Temporarily Inactive">
    **Meaning**: Provider is temporarily inactive (leave, suspension, medical leave).

    **Availability**: Does NOT appear in appointment booking, no slots generated.

    **Actions**: Reactivate to restore access, or permanently remove.

    **Use Case**: Maternity leave, vacation, disciplinary suspension.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/providers_status_toggle.png" alt="Toggle de estado del proveedor para activar, suspender o aprobar" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  **Suspended vs Closures**: Use `suspended` status for long-term inactivity (weeks/months). Use **provider-specific closures** for short-term absences (days/weeks) like vacation or sick leave. Closures preserve the provider's schedule and automatically restore availability when the closure ends.
</Warning>

## Multi-Clinic Providers

When viewing providers, you may notice:

<Info>
  **Same User, Different Clinics**: A user can be a provider in Clinic A but NOT in Clinic B. The `is_provider` flag is stored per-clinic in `user_clinics`.
</Info>

**Example Scenario**:
- **Dr. María García**:
  - Clinic A (Dental Clinic): `is_provider = true` (delivers dental services)
  - Clinic B (Physical Therapy): `is_provider = false` (administrative staff only)

When viewing Clinic A's providers, Dr. García appears. When viewing Clinic B's providers, she does NOT appear (even though she's a user in both clinics).

## Provider Details Modal

Click on a provider card to open detailed information:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Profile Tab">
    - Full name (per-clinic)
    - Email (global)
    - Phone (global)
    - Clinic role
    - Provider status
    - Notes (per-clinic, from `user_clinic_profiles.notes`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Schedule Tab">
    - Work hours by weekday
    - Multiple periods per day (if configured)
    - Intersection with clinic hours (calculated)
    - Upcoming closures (provider-specific)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Services Tab">
    - List of services assigned to this provider
    - Service details (name, duration, price)
    - Quick assign/unassign actions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Appointments Tab">
    - Recent appointments
    - Upcoming appointments
    - Appointment history
    - Performance metrics (completion rate, cancellations)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Empty State

If no providers are configured:

<Warning>
  **No Providers Found**: Your clinic doesn't have any providers configured yet. Without providers, patients cannot book appointments.

  **Next Steps**:
  1. [Create your first provider](/providers/create-provider)
  2. [Configure their schedule](/providers/configure-schedule)
  3. [Assign them to services](/providers/assign-services)
</Warning>

## Common Scenarios

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Provider Missing from List" icon="circle-question">
    **Problem**: User exists but doesn't appear in providers list.

    **Solution**: Check `user_clinics.is_provider` for this clinic. If `false`, the user is not flagged as a provider. Update via [Edit User](/users/edit-user) or create a new provider entry.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provider Appears in Wrong Clinic" icon="building">
    **Problem**: Provider should only work in Clinic A but appears in Clinic B.

    **Solution**: Each clinic has independent provider flags. Verify you're viewing the correct clinic context (clinic selector, top-right). If the provider should NOT be in Clinic B, edit their `user_clinic` entry and set `is_provider = false` for Clinic B.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provider Has No Schedule" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **Problem**: Provider appears in list but has no availability.

    **Solution**: Provider may not have work_hours configured. Navigate to [Configure Schedule](/providers/configure-schedule) to set up their working hours.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provider Has No Services" icon="briefcase-blank">
    **Problem**: Provider appears in list but isn't assigned to any services.

    **Solution**: Navigate to [Assign Services](/providers/assign-services) to link the provider to the services they deliver.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Database Query (For Developers)

```sql
-- Get all providers for a clinic with profile data
SELECT
  uc.id AS user_clinic_id,
  uc.user_id,
  ucp.full_name,
  u.email,
  u.phone_e164,
  uc.is_provider,
  uc.status,
  cr.name AS clinic_role
FROM user_clinics uc
JOIN users u ON uc.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN user_clinic_profiles ucp ON uc.id = ucp.user_clinic_id
LEFT JOIN clinic_roles cr ON uc.clinic_role_id = cr.id
WHERE uc.clinic_id = '...'
  AND uc.is_provider = true
ORDER BY ucp.full_name ASC;
```

<Tip>
  **Performance Optimization**: The query uses indexes on `user_clinics(clinic_id, is_provider)` and `user_clinic_profiles(user_clinic_id)` for fast retrieval.
</Tip>
